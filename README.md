# Urele Link (Project)

Urele Link is a URL shortener that converts long URLs into short ones. Here, the user can shorten long website URLs into shorter links that are easy to send or share. The user can also send the shortened link via various channels, such as email or SMS. After registering or logging in to the website, the user has access to a table displaying previously shortened links and can create groups for desired links. Additionally, the user can add other users, accept requests from others, or join existing groups. There is also an option to track statistics, and the user can view profile information such as password changes, name, etc.

In general, aside from link shortening, the user has access to their data and statistics on previously used links, and they can share the desired link via SMS, email, and other methods.
